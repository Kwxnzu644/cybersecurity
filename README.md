# 🔐 Cybersecurity Learning & Tools Repository

Welcome to my cybersecurity learning and tooling repository — built for mastering **Python**, **C++**, and **Shell scripting** through real-world security and forensics projects.

> 💡 This repo is part of my long-term goal to build **Secverse**, a solo cybersecurity brand focused on offensive security, automation, and cloud AI defense.

## 🧭 Study & Build Roadmap

### 🐍 Python (2025 Focus)
- [ ] Learn scripting fundamentals
- [ ] Automate security tasks (e.g., port scanner, dirbuster, log parser)
- [ ] Work with `subprocess`, `socket`, `argparse`, `scapy`, `requests`
- [ ] Publish tools with usage help and clean output (color/styling)
- [ ] Build phishing simulation scripts
- [ ] Interact with Shodan, VirusTotal, or Whois APIs

### 🐚 Shell Scripting (2025 Focus)
- [ ] Learn Bash fundamentals: variables, loops, conditionals
- [ ] Automate Linux tasks (e.g., update checks, backups, scanning wrappers)
- [ ] Log cleanup, syslog analysis, and scheduling with cron
- [ ] Create an all-in-one setup.sh for pentesting environments

### 💣 C++ (2026–2027 Focus)
- [ ] Learn C++ syntax, pointers, memory management
- [ ] Create low-level red team tools (e.g., simple backdoors, keyloggers)
- [ ] Practice buffer overflows (simulated labs)
- [ ] Use system libraries like `<unistd.h>`, `<sys/socket.h>`
- [ ] Build and compile with `Makefile`

### 🧪 Tools & Labs (`tools/`)
- [ ] Step-by-step guides and exercises for:
  - Nmap, Hydra, Nikto, sqlmap
  - Wireshark, TCPDump, Ettercap
  - Volatility, Autopsy (forensics)
  - Metasploit Framework, Burp Suite
  - Custom VM test environments
